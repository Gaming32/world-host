This version introduces an *experimental* plugin API, as well as compatibility for Simple Voice Chat.

## Experimental Plugin API

1. Depend on World Host through the [Modrinth Maven](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8801191-modrinth-maven).
2. Your plugin's entrypoint class needs to implement `WorldHostPlugin`.
3. On Fabric, specify your entrypoint class through the `worldhost` entrypoint in your fabric.mod.json.
4. On Forge and NeoForge, annotate your entrypoint class with `@WorldHostPlugin.Entrypoint`.
